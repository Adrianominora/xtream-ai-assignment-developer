# xtream AI Challenge

## Ready Player 1? 🚀

Hey there! Congrats on crushing our first screening! 🎉 You're off to a fantastic start!

Welcome to the next level of your journey to join the [xtream](https://xtreamers.io) AI squad. Here's your next mission.

You've got **7 days** to show us your magic, starting now. No rush—work at your own pace. If you need more time, just let us know. We're here to help you succeed. 🤝

### Your Mission

Think of this as a real-world project. Fork this repo and treat it like you're working on something big! When the deadline hits, we'll be excited to check out your work. No need to tell us you're done – we'll know. 😎

🚨 **Remember**: At the end of this doc, there's a "How to run" section left blank just for you. Please fill it in with instructions on how to run your code.

### How We'll Evaluate Your Work

We'll be looking at a bunch of things to see how awesome your work is, like:

* Your approach and method
* How you use your tools (like git and Python packages)
* The neatness of your code
* The readability and maintainability of your code
* The clarity of your documentation

🚨 **Heads Up**: You might think the tasks are a bit open-ended or the instructions aren't super detailed. That’s intentional! We want to see how you creatively make the most out of the problem and craft your own effective solutions.

🚨 **Keep This in Mind**: This isn't about building the fanciest model: we're more interested in your process and thinking.

### Context

Marta, a data scientist at xtream, has been working on a project for a client. She's been doing a great job, but she's got a lot on her plate. So, she's asked you to help her out with this project.

Marta has given you a notebook with the work she's done so far and a dataset to work with. You can find both in this repository.

The model is good enough; now it's time to build the supporting infrastructure.

### Challenge 1

**Develop an automated pipeline** that trains your model with fresh data, keeping it as sharp as the diamonds it assesses. Pick one model to work with—no need to worry about hyperparameter tuning. Maintain a history of all the models you train and save the performance metrics of each model.

### Challenge 2

Level up! Now you need to support **both models** that Marta has developed. Be careful. In the near future, you may want to include more models, so make sure your pipeline is flexible enough to handle that.

### Challenge 3

Build a **REST API** to integrate your model into a web app, making it a breeze for the team to use. Keep it developer-friendly – not everyone speaks 'data scientist'! 
Your API should support two use cases:
1. Predict the value of a diamond.
2. Given the features of a diamond, return n samples from the training dataset with the same cut, color, and clarity, and the most similar weight.

### Challenge 4

Observability is key. Save every request and response made to the APIs to a **proper database**.
